\chapter{Conclusion and further work}

discussion: Using a generative model as a surrogates model is a novel idea - maybe it is not a good
idea.. Discretized regression

Maybe manipulation of variance could be done, or same mean prediction?!? Or 
mean prediction using the means of the close by x-values. 

\section{further work}
Many problems have dimensions of no relevance. Here This might be relevant to investigate

More dimensions of prior weighting?

<Using mixtures of more complicated components, i.e. hundebens distribution>
 
<Parrallel Bayesian OPtimization>

% In this paper, we have only considered function approximation problems. Problems
% requiring classication could be handled analogously with the appropriate models. For
% learning classication with a mixture model, one would select examples so as to maximize
% discriminability between Gaussians; for locally weighted regression, one would use a logistic
% regression instead of the linear one considered here (Weisberg, 1985).
