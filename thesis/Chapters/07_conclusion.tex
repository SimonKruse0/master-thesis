\chapter{Conclusion and further work}

discussion: Using a generative model as a surrogates model is a novel idea - maybe it is not a good
idea.. Discretized regression

Maybe manipulation of variance could be done, or same mean prediction?!? Or 
mean prediction using the means of the close by x-values. 

\section{further work}
Many problems have dimensions of no relevance. Here This might be relevant to investigate

More dimensions of prior weighting?

<Using mixtures of more complicated components, i.e. hundebens distribution>
