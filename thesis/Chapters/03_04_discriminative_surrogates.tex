\chapter{Discriminative surrogate models}
When talking about a surrogate model we usually refer to a discriminative model, meaning
that we model the conditional distribution of y given x directly, typically paramatised by some parameters, $\theta$. 
$$p(y|x, \theta)$$
When talking about a probabilistic surrogate model we are always implicit talking about a
discriminative model: A model of the conditional distribution of the observation, $y$, 
conditional on $x$, i.e., 
$$p(y|x)$$
we also refer to this as the predictive distribution. Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks
are both discriminative models. There is no distribution over the input $x$, it is just given. 
This is indeed sufficient for a surrogate model, where we are interested in the predictive distribution.
