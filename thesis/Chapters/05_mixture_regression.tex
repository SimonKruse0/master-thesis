\chapter{Generative model surrogates}
Generative models are statistical models of the joint distribution $p(x,y)$ We need, however, a
discriminative model for regression, i.e. a model of the conditional distribution of $y$ given $x$,
i.e. $p(y|x)$. All generative models we deal with in this thesis allow for exact inference of the
conditional distribution. So given a well-fitted generative model, one could immediately think they
would be feasible to use as surrogate models. However, in this project, we only look at Gaussian
mixture models as generative models - and they have a problem for $x$-values where the probability
of the observed input data, the marginal $p(x)$, is low. Recall the conditional distribution is 
$$p(y|x) = \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)}$$ and can be interpreted as a slice of the joint distribution
$p(x,y)$ for a fixed value of $x$, but normalized with $p(x) = \int p(x,y) dy$. So even if there is
a very small probability of the data, the conditional probability $p(y|x)$ gets artificially certain
in the case of Gaussian mixtures. We, therefore, need to introduce a prior distribution for $y$,
which will take over in areas for no data, i.e. small $p(x)$. This is discussed in section
%\ref{...}

Using generative models as regression models is not used much in the literature. Using the
conditional of a Gaussian mixture model (or kernel estimator) for regression has been discussed
briefly in \cite{bishop1995neural} and using kernel estimator \cite{ALStatisticalModels} for active
learning. According to these sources, the good reasons for using the mixtures for regression are
that they can be used to represent any relations between the variables, e.g. $p(y|x)$ or $p(x|y)$.
They are both applicable in supervised and unsupervised ml. And they are good at dealing with
incomplete data, i.e. missing values in the data set. \cite{JordanPaper}. However is it a hyposesis
that it will allow for an expressive surrogate model, allowing for dealing with complex BO tasks,
as they do not assume continuity.. In this thesis we will first look at the most simple approach
to a generative model, i.e. putting an equally weighted Gaussian mixture component on each data point. 
This is also referred to as a kernel estimator (some might know then from doing kde-plots/estimating a distribution
from data), but with a twist of including a prior distribution to it. Next, we look at the more intelligent
models, Gaussian mixture models, which hopefully can capture some correlations between the variables. 
And finally, we look at the more complicated sum-product networks, which introduce a generalization element
and have a flavor of a neural network. To summarize, the mixture regression models are:

\begin{itemize}
     \item Naive Gaussian mixture regression (Kernel estimator regression),
     \item Gaussian mixture regression,
     \item Sum-product networks.
 \end{itemize}

\section{Gaussian mixture regression}
Taking a convex combination of a set of multivariate Gaussian distributions is a Gaussian mixture
model
$$p(z) = \sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k \mathcal{N}(z|\mu_k, \Sigma_k)$$  
Defining $z := (x,y)$ we can model our data, as a generative model $p(x,y)$, 
$$p(x,y)= \sum_{k=1}^K \pi^{(k)} \mathcal{N}(x,y|\mu^{(k)},\Sigma^{(k)}), 
\hspace{1cm} \mu^{(k)}=\begin{bmatrix}
    \mu^{(k)}_x \\ \mu^{(k)}_y
\end{bmatrix},\hspace{0.1cm} \Sigma^{(k)} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \Sigma^{(k)}_{xx} & \Sigma^{(k)}_{xy}\\ \Sigma^{(k)}_{yx}& \Sigma^{(k)}_{yy}
\end{bmatrix}$$
This is trained using the EM algorithm. We will now show how the conditional is
calculated exact. 
\subsection{GMR - prediction}
We will now formulate the conditial distribution in terms of conditional and marginals of
the individual mixture components. First of all the marginal distribution $p(x)$ 
of the mixture is given as,
\begin{align*}
    p(x) &= \int p(x,y) dy \\
    &=\sum_{k=1}^K \pi^{(k)} \int \mathcal{N}(x,y|\mu^{(k)},\Sigma^{(k)}) dy\\
    &=\sum_{k=1}^K \pi^{(k)} \mathcal{N}(x|\mu_{x}^{(k)},\Sigma_{xx}^{(k)})
\end{align*}
next the joint distribution can be decomposed with the probability chain rule,
\begin{align*}
    p(x,y) &= p(x)p(y|x)\\
    \implies \hspace{1cm} \mathcal{N}(x,y|\mu,\Sigma) &= 
    \mathcal{N}(x|\mu_{x},\Sigma_{xx}) \mathcal{N}(y|\mu_{y|x},\Sigma_{y|x})
\end{align*} 
And we can formulate the conditional in terms of individual multivariate Gaussians, 

\begin{align}
    p(y|x) &= \frac{p(y,x)}{p(x)}\\
    &= \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{\pi^{(k)}}{p(x)} \mathcal{N}(x,y|\mu^{(k)},\Sigma^{(k)})\\
    &=  \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{\pi^{(k)} \mathcal{N}(x|\mu_{x}^{(k)},\Sigma_{xx}^{(k)})}{p(x)}\mathcal{N}(y|\mu_{y|x}^{(k)},\Sigma_{y|x}^{(k)})\\
    &=  \sum_{k=1}^K \pi_{y|x}^{(k)} p(y|x,\mu_{y|x}^{(k)},\Sigma_{y|x}^{(k)})
\end{align}

where $\pi_{y|x}^{(k)} := \frac{\pi^{(k)} \mathcal{N}(x|\mu_{x}^{(k)},\Sigma_{xx}^{(k)})}
{\sum_{i=1}^K \mathcal{N}(x|\mu_{x}^{(i)},\Sigma_{xx}^{(i)})}$. So we see that 
the conditional of a Gaussian mixture model is again a Gaussian mixture model.


\begin{testexample2}[Conditional og multivariate Gaussian]
    The conditional distribution is defined as \cite{bishop} ..?
    $$p(y|x,\mu, \Sigma) = \mathcal{N}(y|\mu_{y|x},\Sigma_{y|x} )\hspace{1cm} \mu=\begin{bmatrix}
        \mu_x \\ \mu_y
    \end{bmatrix},\hspace{0.1cm} \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
        \Sigma_{xx} & \Sigma_{xy}\\ \Sigma_{yx}& \Sigma_{yy}
    \end{bmatrix}$$ 
    where 
    \begin{align}
        \mu_{y|x} &= \mu_y+\Sigma_{yx}\Sigma_{xx}^{-1}(x-\mu_x)\\
        \Sigma_{y|x} &= \Sigma_{yy}-\Sigma_{yx}\Sigma_{xx}^{-1}\Sigma_{xy} 
    \end{align}
    
\end{testexample2}


\section{Sum product networks}


\subsection{SPN is a mixture model}
We will to a large extend just see SPN as a large mixture model. This is a valid observation. 

%from [@desana]:
\begin{definition} 
    A sub-network $\bar S_z$ of $S$ is an SPN, which includes the root $S$ and then includes nodes
    according to the following recursive scheme: 
\end{definition}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption*{Collection of sub-network $S_z$ of $S$}\label{SPN4}
    \begin{algorithmic}
    %\State \textbf{Global:}  $S_z$ 
    \Function{Process}{node i, $S_z$}
    \If{$i \in \mathcal{L}eaf(S)$}
        \State  $\textbf{return: }$ 
    \EndIf
    %\For{$i \in I_{o}$}
    \If{$i\in \mathcal{S}um(S)$}
       %\State $S_z =S_z \cup \{j \in ch(i)\}$ \Comment{include one child of node $i$}
        \State $S_z =S_z.add(j \in ch(i))$ \Comment{include one child of node $i$}
        \State $\textbf{return: } \text{Process}(j, S_z)$
    \EndIf
    \If{$i\in \mathcal{P}rod(S)$}
        \State $S_z =S_z \cup \{j | j \in ch(i)\}$ \Comment{include all childen of node $i$}
        \For{$j \in ch(i)$}
            \State $\textbf{return: } \text{Process}(j,S_z)$
        \EndFor
    \EndIf
    \State $\textbf{return: } S_z$
    \EndFunction
    \State $S_z =  \text{Process(root,Ã˜)}$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
So we see that at each sum node the number of different sub-networks multiplies with the number of children for that
sum node. And thereby, the total number of sub-networks is
 $$Z = \prod_{i\in \mathcal{S}um(S)}|ch(i)|$$ 
 i.e. an exponentially large amount of sub-networks. This is the amount of
 mixture components implicitly defined in an SPN. 
 Denote the set of edges in the sub-network $\mathcal{E}(S_z)$.
Now the we define a mixture coeficient, $\lambda_z$ and component for each $S_z$ as 
$$\lambda_z := \prod_{(i,j)\in \mathcal{E}(S_z)} w_{i,j}, \hspace{1cm}
p_z(x,y|\theta) := \prod_{i \in \mathcal{L}(S_z)} p_i(x,y)$$
where $p_i(x,y)$ is the leaf distribution at leaf node $i$ paramitised with $\theta$. 
It can now be proven that the SPN can be interpreted as the following mixture model, 
$$p(x,y|w,\theta) = \sum_{z=1}^Z \lambda_z(w)p_z(x,y|\theta)$$
i.e. by the weighted sum of all $Z$ sub-networks. For convinience
we define each sum component as $p(z,x,y|w,\theta) := \lambda_z(w)p_z(x,y|\theta)$.
Evaluation of $p(x,y|w,\theta)$ will never be done as the sum over $Z$ components, 
instead there is a proposition. 

\begin{proposition}
    Consider a SPN, S, a sum node $q \in \mathcal{S}um(S)$ and a child $i \in ch(q)$,
    then the following relation holds, 
    $$\sum_{z:(q,i)\in \mathcal{E}(S_z)} \lambda_z(w) p_z(x,y|\theta) = w_{i,q}
    \frac{\partial S}{\partial v(q)} v(i)$$
\end{proposition}



\subsection{Conditional of SPN}

We will soon see how it is possible to write the conditional distribution as the mixture, 
$$p(y|x) = \sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \gamma(x) p_{z_y}(y)$$
where $ \Sigma(S)$ is the set of all sub-networks in the SPN, $S$ - \todo{IT IS EXPONENTIALLY LARGE}.  
And where $p_{z_y}(y)$ is defined through $p_z(x,y)$, 
\begin{align*}
    p_z(x,y) &= \prod_{l \in \mathcal{L}eaf(z_x)} \phi_l(x)\prod_{l \in \mathcal{L}eaf(z_y)} \phi_l(y)\\
            &=: p_{z_x}(x) p_{z_y}(y) 
\end{align*}
where $\phi_l$ is the density of the $l$'th leafs tractable distribution. Recall that we can interpret an SPN
as the mixture model, 
$$p(x,y) = \sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \lambda_z p_z(x,y)$$
where $\lambda_z = \prod_{(q,j) \in \mathcal{E}(z)} w_{q,j}$. First we calculate the marginal density,
$p(x)$, 
\begin{align*}
    p(x) &= \int p(x,y)dy\\
    &= \int \sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \lambda_z p_z(x,y)dy\\
    %&= \sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \lambda_z  \int p_z(x,y)dy\\
    &= \sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \lambda_z p_{z_x}(x)\int p_{z_y}(y)dy \\
    &= \sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \lambda_z p_{z_x}(x)
\end{align*}
Now we are ready to calculate the conditional density, 
\begin{align*}
    p(y|x) &=  \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)}\\
            &= \frac{\sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \lambda_z p_z(x,y)}{p(x)}\\
            &=\sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)}\frac{ \lambda_z p_{z_x}(x)}{p(x)} p_{z_y}(y)\\
            &=\sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)}\frac{ \lambda_z p_{z_x}(x)}{\sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \lambda_z p_{z_x}(x)} p_{z_y}(y)\\
            &=\sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \gamma(x) p_{z_y}(y)
\end{align*}
So we defined $\gamma(x) = \frac{ \lambda_z p_{z_x}(x)}{\sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \lambda_z p_{z_x}(x)}$ 
and this is very convinient, as we will see soon is 
equavalent to the derivative of the log-likehood
of the SPN, which is easily obtained by automatic differentiation. 

\subsection{calculation of responsibility, $\gamma(x)$}
expectation maximization of a mixture model, is given by Bishop..
the responsibility of a datapoint to belong to one mixture component, is given by
$$\gamma(z_{nk}) = \frac{w_k p_j(x_n)}{\sum_i w_i p_i(x_n)}$$
We can prove that the responsibility is equal to the gradient of the log likehood, 
$$L:= \sum_n \log \sum_j w_j \exp \psi_j(x_n)$$
where we define $\psi_j(x_n) = \log p_j(x_n)$. Take the gradient 
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \psi_{j}(x_{n})} = \frac{w_k p_j(x_n)}{\sum_i w_i p_i(x_n)}$$
Note that the gradient easily can be found using autograd. 


\subsection{Mean and variance of conditional SPN}

The mean of the conditional is just
\begin{align*}
    E_{p(y|x)}[y] &= \sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \gamma(x) \int  y p_{z_y}(y) dy \\
    &= \sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \gamma(x) \prod_{l \in \mathcal{L}eaf(z_y)} E_{\phi_l}[y]
\end{align*}

and the variance is found using the second moment, 
\begin{align*}
    E_{p(y|x)}[y^2] &= \sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \gamma(x) \int  y^2 p_{z_y}(y) dy \\
    &= \sum_{z \in \Sigma(S)} \gamma(x) \prod_{l \in \mathcal{L}eaf(z_y)} (Var_{\phi_l}[y]+E_{\phi_l}[y]^2)
\end{align*}



SPN is an exponential large mixture model, with linear inference - unlike GMM. !?
\todo{Write naive bayesian mixture model as a Sum Product Network}


This thesis will only work with RAT spn. Which takes combinations of each dimension. and...



sum nodes play a role of
mixtures over their children distribution, similar to a classic mixture model

Product
nodes on the other hand, are equivalent to factorizations over independent distributions as they are
combining disjoint RVs.

SPNs can also be interpreted as deep feed forward neural network [@vergari]. Here, imagine the
weights of the sum nodes are parameters, leaf distributions are input neurons, root node is output and
all other nodes correspond to hidden neurons

\subsection{SPN - prediction}
Prior to the inference of the predictive distribution, we assume that the SPN, S, is trained, i.e.
trained leaf distributions $p_j(\cdot)$ for all leaf nodes, 
$j \in \mathcal{L}eaf(S):=\{j \in \mathcal{V}(S) |pa(j) = \text{Ã˜}\}$ and
weights $w_{i,j}$ for the connections between every sum nodes
$i \in \mathcal{S}$ and its children, $j \in ch(i)$.  
%The indexes of the nodes, are ordered such that leafs are first, and parents of leafs are next and then the grandparents and so on.

The joint and the marginal distribution are evaluated in the following recursive way
\begin{algorithm}
    \caption*{Calculation of $p(x,y)$}\label{SPN_1}
    \begin{algorithmic}
    \State \textbf{Input:} Fully trained SPN, with leaf distributions $p_i(\cdot)$ for $i\in \mathcal{L}eaf(S)$ and weigts 
    $w_{i,j}$ for $(i,j) \in \{(i,j)|i \in \mathcal{S}um(S), j \in ch(i)\}$ 
    \Function{\text{Eval}}{node i}
    \If{$i \in \mathcal{L}eaf(S)$}
        \State  $\textbf{return: } p_i(x,y)$ \Comment{evaluate leaf distributions at point $(x,y)$}
    \EndIf
    %\For{$i \in I_{o}$}
    \If{$i\in \mathcal{S}um(S)$}
        \State $\textbf{return: } \sum_{j\in ch(i)} w_{i,j} \text{Eval}(j)$
    \EndIf
    \If{$i\in \mathcal{P}rod(S)$}
        \State $\textbf{return: } \prod_{j \in ch(i)} \text{Eval}(j)$
    \EndIf
    \EndFunction
    \State $p(x) =  \text{Eval(root)}$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption*{Calculation of $p(x)$}\label{SPN}
    \begin{algorithmic}
    \State \textbf{Input:} Fully trained SPN, with leaf distributions $p_i(\cdot)$ for all leaves $i$ and weigts $w_{\cdot,\cdot}$ 
    \Function{\text{Eval}}{node i}
    \If{$i \in \mathcal{L}eaf(S)$} %\Comment{leaf node}
        \If{node handle x}
            \State  $\textbf{return: } p_i(x,y)$ \Comment{evaluate leaf distributions at point $(x,y)$}
        \Else 
            \State  $\textbf{return: } 1$ \Comment{set node equal 1 at point $(x,y)$}
        \EndIf
    \EndIf
    \If{$i\in \mathcal{S}um(S)$}
        \State $\textbf{return: } \sum_{j\in ch(i)} w_{i,j} \text{Eval}(j)$
    \EndIf
    \If{$i\in \mathcal{P}rod(S)$}
        \State $\textbf{return: } \prod_{j \in ch(i)} \text{Eval}(j)$
    \EndIf
    \EndFunction
    \State $p(x) =  \text{Eval(root)}$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

So after doing two slightly different forward passes through the SPN, 
$p(x)$ and $p(x,y)$, using Bayes rule,
we can combined the two queries into the conditional distribution: 
$$p(y|x) = \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)}$$
The predictive distribution is found with a cost of just $O(E+E+1) = O(E)$, where E is number
of edges/connections in the SPN. 

\subsection{SPN - learning}
It is not enouth to do predictive inference on a SPN, we also need to fit it on
the data. It is possible interpret sum-product network as a large mixture model 
and therefore use expectation-maximization to train the model. 
We will introduce that idea now. The Paper \cite{SPN_EM}... %["Learning Arbitrary Sum-Product Network Leaves
%with Expectation-Maximization"] 
defines SPN as a mixture of all sub-networks of an SPN.

%from [@desana]:
\begin{definition} 
    A sub-network $\bar S_z$ of $S$ is an SPN, which includes the root $S$ and then includes nodes
    according to the following recursive scheme: 
\end{definition}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption*{Collection of sub-network $S_z$ of $S$}\label{SPN3}
    \begin{algorithmic}
    %\State \textbf{Global:}  $S_z$ 
    \Function{Process}{node i, $S_z$}
    \If{$i \in \mathcal{L}eaf(S)$}
        \State  $\textbf{return: }$ 
    \EndIf
    %\For{$i \in I_{o}$}
    \If{$i\in \mathcal{S}um(S)$}
        \State $S_z =S_z.add(j \in ch(i))$ \Comment{include one child of node $i$}
        \State $\textbf{return: } \text{Process}(j, S_z)$
    \EndIf
    \If{$i\in \mathcal{P}rod(S)$}
        \State $S_z =S_z \cup \{j | j \in ch(i)\}$ \Comment{include all childen of node $i$}
        \For{$j \in ch(i)$}
            \State $\textbf{return: } \text{Process}(j,S_z)$
        \EndFor
    \EndIf
    \State $\textbf{return: } S_z$
    \EndFunction
    \State $S_z =  \text{Process(root,Ã˜)}$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
So we see that at each sum node the number of different sub-networks multiplies with the number of children for that
sum node. And thereby, the total number of sub-networks is
 $$Z = \prod_{i\in \mathcal{S}um(S)}|ch(i)|$$ 
 i.e. an exponentially large amount of sub-networks. This is the amount of
 mixture components implicitly defined in an SPN. 
 Denote the set of edges in the sub-network $\mathcal{E}(S_z)$.
Now the we define a mixture coeficient, $\lambda_z$ and component for each $S_z$ as 
$$\lambda_z := \prod_{(i,j)\in \mathcal{E}(S_z)} w_{i,j}, \hspace{1cm}
p_z(x,y|\theta) := \prod_{i \in \mathcal{L}(S_z)} p_i(x,y)$$
where $p_i(x,y)$ is the leaf distribution at leaf node $i$ paramitised with $\theta$. 
It can now be proven that the SPN can be interpreted as the following mixture model, 
$$p(x,y|w,\theta) = \sum_{z=1}^Z \lambda_z(w)p_z(x,y|\theta)$$
i.e. by the weighted sum of all $Z$ sub-networks. For convinience
we define each sum component as $p(z,x,y|w,\theta) := \lambda_z(w)p_z(x,y|\theta)$.
Evaluation of $p(x,y|w,\theta)$ will never be done as the sum over $Z$ components, 
instead there is a proposition. 

\begin{proposition}
    Consider a SPN, S, a sum node $q \in \mathcal{S}um(S)$ and a child $i \in ch(q)$,
    then the following relation holds, 
    $$\sum_{z:(q,i)\in \mathcal{E}(S_z)} \lambda_z(w) p_z(x,y|\theta) = w_{i,q}
    \frac{\partial S}{\partial v(q)} v(i)$$
\end{proposition}
