% Abstract
%  1. Motivation. Why do we care?
Bayesian optimization is the leading way in sample efficient optimization. Tuning
hyper parameters in machine learning and deep learning. 

%  2. Problem formulation. What problem will we solve?
%     2.b. Current state. What have others done, and why is that not enough?
However, from a decision theretically standpoint, assuming the probalistic surrogate model to be correct 
is crucial for the correct decision. We will investigate if other surrogate models 
could be better than a GP. 

%  3. Approach. What is our big idea? How did we solve it?
%     3.a. Analysis and experiments. What research did we do?
Mixture regression, and SPN, modeling the trying out BNN.

%  4. Results. What is the answer?
%  5. Conclusions. What are the implications?
