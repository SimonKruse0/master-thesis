This thesis is the culmination of the last years excitement about Bayesian statistics and Bayesian
computing. I found probability theory very hard when I was introduced to it in 2017, and I only knew
statistics like p-values and t-tests, and I was tired of looking at plots without really understanding
why they made sense. Not satisfied with, from my point of view the "fluffy handwaving"- statistics - I
avoided many of the statistics courses and found happiness in the hardcore proof-founded courses such as
real analysis, abstract algebra, and numerical optimization. However, since machine learning was my big
passion and the reason why I chose to study applied mathematics, at some point I was introduced to
probabilistic machine learning, using Bayesian statistics. Learning about Bayesian statistics
flipped around my view on statistics for good. The concept of a probabilistic model came very late and
was a game-changer. I had a very good course at TU Delft, \textit{statistical inference} - a hardcore
proof-founded course, which helped my frustrations of not truly understanding what p-values and
statistical tests are.
