This thesis is the culmination of my last year's excitement about Bayesian statistics and
probabilistic machine learning. I would like to thank my supervisors, Mikkel N. Schmidt and Bjørn
Sand Jensen for the opportunity to dive into the world of probabilistic models and Bayesian
optimization, for interesting discussions, good guidance, and support throughout the duration of
this thesis. 

Furthermore, I would like to thank my office mates, Søren Hartmann and Rasmus Tirsgaard, for important
discussions and their great company. 


% This thesis is the culmination of the last few year's excitement about Bayesian statistics and Bayesian
% computing. I found probability theory very hard when I was introduced to it in 2017. And I only knew
% statistics like p-values and t-tests, and I was tired of looking at plots without understanding
% why they made sense. Not satisfied with, from my point of view, the "fluffy handwaving"- statistics - I
% avoided many of the statistics courses and found happiness in the hardcore proof-founded courses such as
% real analysis, abstract algebra, and numerical optimization. However, since machine learning was my big
% passion and the reason why I chose to study applied mathematics, at some point, I was introduced to
% probabilistic machine learning using Bayesian statistics. Learning about Bayesian statistics
% flipped around my view on statistics for good. The concept of a probabilistic model came very late and
% was a game-changer. I had an excellent course at TU Delft, \textit{statistical inference} - a hardcore
% proof-founded course, which helped my frustrations of not truly understanding what p-values and
% statistical tests are.



%Even though we never really spoke, I need to thank Professor Frank van der Meulen for his 
% Tommy Sonne Alstrøm was my tutor in 2017, his advice to me of focusing on the hard mathematics courses
% gave me encouragement to take the hard math courses, with no obvious relevance to the world. Today
% I consider real and functional analysis courses the most important courses for maturing my
% mathematical mindset. I need to thank my two supervisors <..>

% This thesis is also a natural extension of my bachelor thesis in numerical optimization
% \textit{Trust-region methods for structural optimization}, with Martin Skovgaard and.. This thesis
% is all that I wanted, being the combination between
